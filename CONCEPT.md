## Project Description
An app that prepares a meal plan for you based on your private blood test results.   

## Problem Statement
People often learn about nutrient deficiencies from blood test results, but they typically lack guidance on how to adjust their diet effectively. By linking an individual’s nutrient shortages with the Spoonacular API, we can generate personalised recipe recommendations that help restore nutrient balance. This makes dietary improvement simple, practical, and guided by real health data.

## API Selection
**API Name:** Spoonacular
**API Documentation:** https://spoonacular.com/ 
**Why this API?** Search through thousands of recipes using advanced filtering and ranking. 
This method combines searching by query, by ingredients, and by nutrients into one endpoint.
